This error code means access violation => could be anything.

1. If you use third-party antivirus make sure it's not interfering with the game and add BattleBit and EAC folder to exclusions. If it won't help - delete it (especially trend micro).
2. Try running `BattlebitEAC.exe` or `EasyAntiCheat.exe` as admin located in installed files.
